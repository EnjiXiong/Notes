# Notes
This repository is aimed to record some notes in the lecture. 

Since there are more and more courses about the computer science, it's more convenient to record the notes online in preference to hand-writing ones.

The repository begins on the 29th, Sept, 2024.

Today is Jan, 3rd, 2025. To make a better notes and review of the lectures, I'm going to upload the annotated lecture PPTs or PDFs rather than the original ones of those lectures with prepared teaching files.

**Notation**

The repository only contains non-common core courses.
