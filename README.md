# Notes
This repository is aimed to record some notes in the lecture. 

Since there are more and more courses about the computer science, it's more convenient to record the notes online in preference to hand-writing ones.

The repository begins on the 29th, Sept, 2024.

**Notation**

The repository only contains non-common core courses.
